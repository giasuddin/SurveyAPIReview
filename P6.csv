I typically take other opinions with a grain of salt, as it has been my experience that often those opinions are dated or based on misconceptions or the inexperience of the developer. I only truly value opinions when they are directly from the source; for instance, Firebase team members are active on Stack Overflow.","I'm typically looking to have a very specific question answered. I query Google with this question and often specifically look for Stack Overflow (or perhaps Google Groups) results. If I don't get those results immediately, I'll filter results by specifying ""site:stackoverflow.com"" in the query.","Poor quality questions, or questions without answers can be frustrating. Needless to say, when nobody else is encountering a specific problem or there's no practical way of formulating a query to search for it and there aren't any relevant responses. In these cases, I will typically draft a question on Stack Overflow, but first put some more effort into resolving it before ultimately posting it. If I have in the meantime found a resolution, I'll answer my own question.

I also find it frustrating when an accepted answer is clearly not a good solution or doesn't properly address a problem (and instead suggests an alternative or workaround).

Especially on the topic of opinion-related questions, Stack Overflow is typically very sensitive as these are discouraged.","I typically do not simply look at accepted answers. I test them against my expectations, and review other answers, especially those voted on. I also look at the experience of the person having given the answer, and the way in which the answer is formulated. I will also read any comments to hear opposing opinions.","No","I don't know","","Solid documentation is a must. I want to see some sample code, and if I can't grasp it within a few lines, I'm not likely to want to invest the effort. Adding a dependency should be easy. For Android, I want to be able to add a Maven or Jcenter dependency and give it a swing within a few minutes.

I also think it's important that the API is open source and maintained. This way, I can ensure that it will remain working in the long term.","I think it's mostly up to moderation of each forum independently to keep these threads connected. Either by closing duplicate questions, or making reference to related discussions.","There's a real problem that Android developers face among open source libraries: which library should I choose? I think most developers simply select the one that has the most stars on GitHub as there's no real quantifier for quality. I tend to glance at activity in the issue tracker, recent commits or release frequency.","I'm concerned that extracting this data away from its source may lead to outdated information and slow response to API updates.

Some features only perceived as bad until you have a deeper understanding. Also the task must be similar enough to mine.

As an example, I often has stricter performance requirements, like I need to draw 50000 points so opinions on performance with 50 points are irrelevant to me.","There is a ""How to disagree"" essay by Paul Graham  http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html . The quality of arguments in a discussion matters. If arguments are of sensible quality (DH3 and higher in Graham's terms), then there is more trust. There are sometimes built in reputation, pinned topics, FAQs or even discussion length. I also developed a heuristic with ""stop words"" and ""stop opinions"" only noobs say/express.

Quality of documentation and support (e.g. if pull requests are accepted with little bureacracy or opinionated bike shed color style discussions). The maturity of API. Other works of its creators.
